# Who?
Hello there ğŸ‘‹ People usually call me TechHq (Hq doesn't stand for headquarters ğŸ˜’)
<br>
<br>
One day I realised I kind of want to be a web-developer (graduating as a translator doesn't seem to bring fortunes and is also lame)
<br>
Web-development on the hand seems fun and creative to me (i started like a week ago from posting this, no bully ğŸ˜©)
<br>
<br>
I'm currently learning front-end stuff and slowly but steady I'm getting there!
